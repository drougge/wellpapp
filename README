Server part of wellpapp, a system for image tagging.
It's not ready for general use anyway, so instructions will be sparse for now.

Look at example.conf, make whatever changes you feel like, but at least
change the GUID. Then make directories dump, log and mm_cache in basedir.

Build the server with "make". You can set CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS etc to find
includes or whatever. Needs openssl and libbz2, bundles utf8proc.
Run with ./server config.conf

Then you need something that talks to the server. Or make your own,
protocol.txt is actually pretty complete.
