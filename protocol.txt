Line oriented. Each line sent to server is a separate command, each line
returned represents a separate object in the reply. Results from commands
are prefixed with "R". Replies are terminated with "OK" (without "R") or a
line beginning with "E" for errors.

Each line consist of one initial letter for the command, followed by one or
more space separated arguments.

Commands:
S - search
T - tag a post
A - add a new object
N - nop (to keep server from closing idle connection)
Q - quit

S:
First char of first argument determines if search is for a post ("P") or a
tag ("T").
	P:
	Arguments:
		T: Set tag
		t: Not set tag
		O: Ordering of results
		F: Flag (request some data to be returned)
		M: Find specific post.
	T and t:
		Specify tag by name ("N") or guid ("G").
		Prefix tag-spec with "~" to find only weak tags, or "!" to
		find only strong tags.
	O:
		Currently "date" or "score". Prefix with - to reverse sort.
	F:
		Available flags:
			tagname: Return name of set tags.
			tagguid: Return guid of set tags.
			ext: Return file-type in the form of a likely
				extension. Currently one of "jpeg", "gif",
				"png", "bmp" or "swf".
			created: Time as a unix timestamp (UTC).
			width: Width in pixels.
			height: Height in pixels.
	M:
		md5 of post. Can not be specified together with "T" or "t".
		Can only be specified once.
	Returned posts are ordered according to O arguments, or not at all.
	Returned data for each post in not ordered, except that the Ntg
	tagname is for the same tag as the Nth tagguid.
	Example:
		SPTNfoo t~G29kQAF-qto48a-aaaaaa-aaaaaf O-date Fext
	Example reply:
		RGyBYR8f-qto48a-aaaaaa-aaaaa0 P0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef Tfoo T~bar G~foYYLK-qto48a-aaaaaa-aaaa79 Fext=jpeg

	T:
	Not really implemented yet, can only be used to find a tag using
	complete name ("N") or guid ("G").
	Example:
		STNnekomimi

T:
Arguments:
	P: md5 of post
	T: guid of a tag to add
	t: guid of a tag to remove
Exactly one P must be specified as the first argument, any number of "T" and
"t" may be specified.  Replies only "OK". On error, acceptable arguments
preceding the erronious one are applied. GUIDs may be prefixed with "~" to
apply the tag weakly.
Example:
	TP0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef T29kQAF-qto48a-aaaaaa-aaaaaf

A:
Not implemented yet.

N:
Replies "OK".
